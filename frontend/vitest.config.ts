/**
 * Vitest config for the frontend component/unit suite.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from vite.config.ts: the dev server config carries an
 * HTTPS cert lookup, a /api proxy and the PWA plugin, none of which mean
 * anything under jsdom. Reusing that file would drag file-system cert reads
 * into every test run.
 *
 * Tests import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest" explicitly rather than
 * relying on `globals: true`, so the files typecheck under the repo's existing
 * tsconfig (no "vitest/globals" types entry needed) and `npm run build` keeps
 * covering them via tsc -b.
