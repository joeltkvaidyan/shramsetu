# ShramSetu — Architecture (current)

Companion to [README.md](../README.md) and [WORKFLOW.md](../WORKFLOW.md)
(deep walkthrough). This file is the quick, factual map of what runs where.

> **The stack is Node/Express + MongoDB, plus a separate Python/FastAPI AI
> service for RAG only.** An earlier version of this project was a single
> Python FastAPI backend with SQLModel/SQLite. That version is gone; documents
> describing it are in [`archive/`](archive/) and are marked as history.

## Services

| Service | Stack | Port | Entry |
|---|---|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind (PWA) | 5173 (dev; `start-all.ps1` uses 5199) | `frontend/` |
| API server | Node.js 22 + Express 4 + Mongoose 8 | 8000 | `server/src/index.js` → `app.js` |
| AI service | Python 3.10 + FastAPI | 8100 | `ai-service/main.py` (uvicorn) |
| MongoDB | 8.0 (embedded dev instance or real) | 27017 | `MONGODB_URI` in `server/.env` |

## System architecture

```mermaid

    B["Browser<br/>React + TS (PWA)"]
    E["Express API :8000<br/>JWT auth, rate limit,<br/>scope check, audit"]
    M[("MongoDB :27017<br/>workers, grievances,<br/>documents, wages")]
    A["FastAPI AI :8100<br/>PII strip, translate,<br/>retrieve, answer"]
    X["Groq / Sarvam / Google<br/>LLM, MT, STT, TTS"]

    B -- "JWT over /api" --> E
    E -- "Mongoose" --> M
    E -- "X-Internal-Key" --> A
    A -- "API keys" --> X
    B -. "voice (STT/TTS)" .-> A

    classDef db fill:#e8f0fe,stroke:#4285f4
    classDef ext fill:#fef7e0,stroke:#f9ab00
    class M db
    class X ext
```

Two deliberate choices:

- **The browser never calls the AI service.** Only the Node server does, and
  every call must carry `X-Internal-Key`. That keeps provider keys off the
  client and means AI traffic can be rate-limited and audited in one place.
- **The AI service holds no database.** It is stateless and reads only its
  document corpus, so it can be scaled or restarted without touching worker data.

## RAG pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Q["Question (worker language)"]
    T["Translate to English<br/>cached on disk"]
    D["FAISS dense search<br/>top 24 candidates"]
    G{"Similarity<br/>≥ 0.45?"}
    R["Rerank: RRF of<br/>BM25(translation)<br/>+ BM25(original)"]
    K["Top 3 deduped chunks<br/>+ source metadata"]
    L["Groq generates answer<br/>in the worker's language"]
    N{"Grounded in<br/>the context?"}
    Y["Answer + sources + confidence"]
    X["Refuse: 'could not find'"]

    Q --> T --> D --> G
    G -- "no" --> X
    G -- "yes" --> R --> K --> L --> N
    N -- "yes" --> Y
    N -- "no" --> X
```

The 0.45 gate is the refusal mechanism: an off-topic or prompt-injected question
never reaches the LLM with context attached. BM25 reranks only chunks that
already passed the gate, so it can reorder but never admit a below-threshold
chunk. Measured on the 70-question suite: hit@1 94%, hit@3 98%, retrieval
refusals 12/13 — see [eval/ANALYSIS.md](../ai-service/eval/ANALYSIS.md).

## SOS flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant W as Worker (app)
    participant E as Express
    participant G as Government console
    W->>E: POST /api/sos (location, token)
    E->>E: Auth, scope, audit
    E-->>W: 202 accepted, reference id
    E->>G: SOS alert (console inbox)
    W->>E: POST /api/sos/:id/resolve (status)
    E->>G: status update
    Note over W,E: SMS/call escalation is NOT wired —<br/>the alert exists only inside the app.
```

**Known limit:** SOS alerts reach the government console over the API but do
not trigger an SMS, email or phone call. It is an in-app acknowledgement, not a
push-to-volunteer system.

## Grievance flow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft
    Draft --> Submitted: worker submits
    Submitted --> UnderReview: official picks up
    UnderReview --> ActionTaken: resolution recorded
    UnderReview --> Rejected: rejected with reason
    ActionTaken --> Escalated: worker escalates
    Rejected --> Escalated: worker escalates
    Escalated --> UnderReview: re-opened
    ActionTaken --> [*]
```

Jurisdiction scoping is enforced in `server/src/utils/scope.js`: an official can
only read and act on grievances inside their assigned state/district. This is
covered by the server test suite (10 parity tests).

`start-all.ps1` / `stop-all.ps1` manage the three app services on Windows;
each can also be started manually (see README). The frontend talks only to
the Node server (`/api` proxy); only the Node server talks to the AI
service, and every such request must carry `X-Internal-Key`.

## Request flow

```
Browser ──JWT──► Express (auth → rate limit → route)
                   │                     │
                   │                     └──► MongoDB (Mongoose models)
                   └──X-Internal-Key──► FastAPI (PII strip → translate →
                                          FAISS → gate → Groq) ──► Groq/Sarvam/Google
```

## Cold start

The AI service is three heavy models and one vector index, loaded in background
threads at boot. Uvicorn binds `:8100` the instant those threads are *spawned* —
not when they finish — so for the first ~30s the port answers while `/ask`
cannot. The service tracks its own warm-up state in `app/core/warmup.py` and
reports it honestly:

| Endpoint | While warming | Once ready | Why both exist |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /health/live` | 200 | 200 | Liveness only. Never reflects warm-up — restarting a warming service restarts the very load it is waiting on. |
| `GET /health/ready` | **503** + which model is loading | 200 | Readiness. What `start-all.ps1` and any deploy script should gate on. |
| `GET /health` | 200, `ready:false` | 200, `ready:true` | Liveness + full warm-up state. `status` stays `"ok"` for existing consumers. |

`rag` is **required** (without it `/ask` cannot answer). `translation` and the
two `stt` models are **optional**: they are cloud/local fallbacks, so a failure
becomes a `warnings` entry instead of a 503. `translation` reports `skipped`
when a cloud MT engine is active — a deliberate choice to keep ~1 GB of RAM
free, not a fault.

A `/ask` that lands mid-warm-up waits up to `WARMUP_WAIT_SECONDS` (90) for the
index, then answers, rather than either serving from a half-loaded model or
hanging until the Node proxy aborts at 120s. Past that bound it returns a fast
503 and the Node proxy shows the worker the localised "still starting" message.

## Configuration surfaces

| File | Key variables |
|---|---|
| `server/.env` | `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `DOC_MASTER_KEY`, `AI_INTERNAL_KEY`, `CORS_ORIGINS`, `OTP_ECHO_ENABLED`, `SEED_DEMO_DATA`, `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, rate-limit knobs |
| `ai-service/.env` | `AI_INTERNAL_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`/`GROQ_MODEL`, `SARVAM_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `TTS_PROVIDER`, `RAG_MIN_SIMILARITY`, `RAG_TOP_K`, `AI_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MIN` |
| `frontend/.env` | none required in dev (Vite proxy) |

`.env.example` files document each variable; real `.env` files are
gitignored. Production boot of the server fails without the safe
configuration described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
